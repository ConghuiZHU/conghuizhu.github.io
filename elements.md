#EDUCATION
MA in Linguistics															        2024
Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Shanghai, China)
Thesis title: “The Effect of Topic and Focus on Pronoun Resolution in Chinese Discourse”
		Supervised by Prof. Dr. Fuyun Wu
BSc (minor) in Applied Psychology											2022
East China Normal University (Shanghai, China)
BA (major) in English Linguistics											2021
Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Shanghai, China)

#ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE
MA thesis Project: Evaluating the Bayesian Models of Pronoun Interpretation		2021-2023
Aim 1: Investigating the effect of Topic and Focus on (a) the probability of a referent being mentioned again (b) the probability of a referent being mentioned in pronominal form
• Carried out 2 story-continuation experiments using the platform Gorilla to present audio stimuli with pictures to facilitate understanding
• Coded the continuations, conducted statistical analysis and computed model fit
• Results: Topic affects (a) and (b), Focus affects only (a); supporting the weak version of Bayesian Model, but not the strong version
Aim 2: Revealing on-line processing pattern of pronouns in mini-narratives containing both topical and focused referents 
• Carried out a visual-world eye-tracking experiment
• Analysed the fixation patterns and computed model fit
• Results: Topic and Focus compete to be the antecedent of a pronoun when co-present in the same discourse; Model fit result supporting the Mirror Model 
Principal Advisor: Prof. Dr. Fuyun Wu

Prof. Dr. Fuyun Wu’s Research Group, Coherence Relations Project				2022-2023
Aim: Investigating how prenominal relative clauses of varying semantic contents modulate causal relation expectations in real-time discourse processing 
• Co-experimenter of a reading eye-tracking experiment
• Conducted data cleaning and analysis
• Results: Coherence relation computation started before the end of the matrix clause, and such rapid computation affects the expectation of a following connective in the upcoming discourse
Principal Advisor: Prof. Dr. Fuyun Wu

BA thesis Project: Prosodic Realization of Pronouns in Discourse					2019-2021
Aim: Investigating how prosodic realizations of third person pronouns in Mandarin could help assess differential accessibility statuses of topical versus focused referents
•  Recorded 18 native speakers of standard Mandarin reading mini-narratives that contain topical and focused referents, and a following pronoun referring to either of the referents
•  Used Praat to annotate and extract the phonetic features of pronouns in different types of context
• Results: Accessibility statuses of referents vary dynamically, being influenced by a range of factors (places in the discourse, syntactic position, information status, and possibly the length of the noun phrases), and these variations can be captured by the phonetic features of pronouns
Principal Advisor: Prof. Dr. Fuyun Wu

College Students’ Innovation Program: China’s Image in South African Media: A Corpus-Based Study 																		2017-2018
Aim: Analysing the main sources and topics of the South African public news about China, constructing a small specialized corpus to provide linguistic evidence of China’s image in South Africa
•  Participated in the construction of a small corpus for specific use: collected reports related to 
China in AllAfrica, a website that aggregates and produces news on the African continent
•  Extracting the collocations of interest using AntConc 
•  Providing insight on how news reports shape China’s image from a linguistic perspective
 Principal Advisor: Prof. Dr. Changpeng Huan
